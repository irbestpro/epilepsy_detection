# epilepsy_detection
EEG signals epilepsy detection by following steps:

* Noise Removing by applying MSPCA algorithm.
* Extract signals coefficients and details by applying wpd (Wavelet packet decomposition), dwt, emd and ceemdan algorithms.
* Feature selection by using binary gravitational search algorithm.
* Final prediction by KNN,SVM,ANN and Random forest models.
